# Complex Nesting Checklist

- [ ] Baseline utilisation (%) recorded with current layout
- [ ] Sheet size, kerf, and edge margin confirmed
- [ ] Part rotations allowed (90°/180°) as per spec
- [ ] Grouping by similar contours applied
- [ ] Lead-in/out points optimised to reduce dross
- [ ] Critical features compensated with kerf values
- [ ] Pierce count minimised; edge-start used where possible
- [ ] Recomputed utilisation (%) and cost/part documented
- [ ] Saved layout and parameters for repeat jobs
