## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Path length unclear | Use nesting software to verify total length |
| Material not in stock | Add lead time + surcharge for special order |
| Complex geometry | Add complexity factor (10-30% time increase) |
| Tight tolerances | Note secondary operations required |
| Rush order requested | Apply rush fee (25-50% surcharge) |

---

## Useful Formulas

**Cutting Time Estimation:**
```
Time (min) = Path Length (m) / Cutting Speed (m/min) + Pierce Time
```

**Material Utilization:**
```
Utilization % = (Part Area / Sheet Area) × 100
Target: 75-85% for profitability
```

**Break-Even Analysis:**
```
Break-Even Price = Total Cost / (1 - Target Margin %)
Example: $100 cost / (1 - 0.30) = $142.86 quote price
```

**Next Steps After Quote Approval:**
1. Create job traveler/work order
2. Schedule production slot
3. Order material if not in stock
4. Assign to operator with priority level
5. Set up quality inspection checkpoints
