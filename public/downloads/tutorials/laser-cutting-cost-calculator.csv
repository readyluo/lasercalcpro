## FORMULAS (For Excel Version)
"Cutting Time (min) = Total Length (m) / Speed (mm/min) * 1000"
"Pierce Time (min) = Pierce Count * Pierce Time (sec) / 60"
"Total Machine Time = Cutting Time + Pierce Time"
"Gas Cost = Machine Time (hr) * Flow Rate * Gas Price"
"Setup Labor = Setup Time / 60 * Hourly Rate"
"Overhead = Direct Costs * Overhead %"
"Quoted Price = Total Cost / (1 - Margin %)"
